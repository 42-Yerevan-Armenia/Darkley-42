# Darkley-42

## Project Description
This project introduces you to the basics of cybersecurity, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities commonly found on websites. You'll explore real-world security risks and learn how to identify and exploit them by auditing a vulnerable website. The aim is to help you understand common security flaws such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more. Throughout the project, you'll apply your knowledge to identify and exploit breaches, working through different challenges in a controlled environment.

The project will be evaluated on your ability to demonstrate and explain the solutions you find for each breach, with a specific focus on understanding the vulnerabilities rather than using automated tools. If you complete the mandatory part of the project perfectly, you'll be eligible for the bonus part, which involves providing advanced explanations of the most recognized breaches.

### [12-Stored XSS](https://github.com/Aramxxx8691/Darkley-42/tree/master/12-Stored%20XSS/Ressources/README.md)  
Injects malicious scripts into webpages that are stored and executed later.
### [13-Reflected XSS](https://github.com/Aramxxx8691/Darkley-42/tree/master/13-Reflected%20XSS/Ressources/README.md)  
Injects malicious scripts into requests that reflect back in web responses.

## üåê OWASP ‚Äì Open Worldwide Application Security Project
OWASP is a global non-profit organization that works to improve the security of software. It's one of the most respected names in the cybersecurity community, especially when it comes to web application security.

### üîé What It Does:
- Creates free, open-source tools and documentation for anyone interested in building or testing secure applications.
- Maintains the famous OWASP Top 10, a regularly updated list of the most dangerous web vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
- Hosts community projects, events, and conferences that bring together developers, researchers, and security experts worldwide.

### üõ† Popular OWASP Projects:
- OWASP Top 10 ‚Äì The most well-known list of common web security risks.
- ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) ‚Äì A free tool to help test the security of websites.
- Security Cheat Sheets ‚Äì Simple best-practice guides for secure development.

### üß† Why It Matters:
OWASP is trusted by companies, developers, and governments to define security standards and help build safer systems. It‚Äôs not just for hackers or experts‚Äîit‚Äôs for anyone who wants to avoid building insecure software.


## Commands us

### Nikto (Web Server Vulnerability Scanner)
```
nikto -h http://target.com
```
This command scans the target web server for vulnerabilities.

### Dirb (Web Directory Brute-force Scanner)
```
dirb http://target.com /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt\
```
This command performs a brute-force scan to discover hidden directories on the target web server using the provided wordlist.

### Hydra (Password Brute-force Tool)
```
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://target.com
```
This command attempts to perform a brute-force SSH login with the username admin and passwords from the passwords.txt wordlist.
